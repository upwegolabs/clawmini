# Development Log - Sessions Feature

## Progress
- Picked up Ticket 1: Update Configuration Schema & Types
- Picked up Ticket 2: CLI Flag for Sessions
- Picked up Ticket 3: State Storage Utilities

## Completed Ticket 3
- Implemented `getChatSettingsPath` and `getAgentSessionSettingsPath` path resolution functions.
- Implemented asynchronous storage utilities `readChatSettings`, `writeChatSettings`, `readAgentSessionSettings`, and `writeAgentSessionSettings` using `node:fs/promises` in `src/shared/workspace.ts`.
- Created robust test suite `src/shared/workspace.test.ts` to ensure utility correctness, path resolution, and error handling for nonexistent/invalid files.
- `npm run check` and `npm run test` both completed successfully.

## Completed Ticket 2
- Added `-s, --session <id>` flag to the CLI `messages send` command in `src/cli/commands/messages.ts`.
- Updated tRPC `send-message` schema in `src/daemon/router.ts` to accept an optional `sessionId` string parameter.
- Added an E2E test in `src/cli/e2e.test.ts` verifying flag parsing and successful payload transmission to the daemon.
- All checks (`npm run lint`, `npm run check`, `npm run test`) passed.

## Completed Ticket 1
- Updated `SettingsSchema` in `src/shared/config.ts` to include `append`, `getSessionId`, and `getMessageContent` commands.
- Verified that `z.record(z.string(), z.string())` is correctly used.
- Verified `npm run check` and `npm run test` passed.
## Completed Ticket 4
- Updated `handleUserMessage` in `src/daemon/message.ts` to accept an optional `sessionId`.
- Implemented session resolution logic matching `chatSettings.sessions[agentId]` if `sessionId` is omitted.
- Implemented environment variable injection and command fallback (`commands.append` vs `commands.new`) depending on whether agent session settings exist.
- Passed `sessionId` via TRPC mutation in `src/daemon/router.ts`.
- Updated unit tests in `src/daemon/message.test.ts` heavily mocking `readChatSettings`, `readAgentSessionSettings`, and `spawn` ensuring test isolation by separating cache directories.
- All checks (`npm run check`, `npm run test`) passed.

## Completed Ticket 5
- Modified `runCommand` signature in `src/daemon/message.ts` to return an object `{ stdout, stderr, exitCode }` instead of resolving `void` and internally calling `appendMessage`. Added support for an optional `stdin` argument.
- Implemented extraction logic inside `handleUserMessage`: after the main command finishes, we spawn `getSessionId` and `getMessageContent` by invoking `runCommand` with `stdin: mainResult.stdout`.
- Updates the Chat Settings and Agent Session Settings correctly using `writeChatSettings` and `writeAgentSessionSettings` respectively, upon successful execution of `getSessionId`.
- Propagates any error messages from the extraction commands to `extractionError` which gets gracefully concatenated to `stderr` of the main log output.
- Refactored `runCommand` in `src/daemon/router.ts` and `src/daemon/message.test.ts` to adhere to the new signature and support piping to `stdin`.
- Verified changes with extensive unit tests covering the multi-command spawning behavior and state file persistence logic in `src/daemon/message.test.ts`.
- `npm run check`, `npm run test`, and `npm run lint` all passed successfully.

## Completed Ticket 6
- Added `extractedMessage?: string` to the `CommandLogMessage` interface in `src/shared/chats.ts`.
- Removed TODO comments in `src/daemon/message.ts` regarding `extractedMessage`.
- Wrote full multi-message session E2E test in `src/cli/e2e.test.ts` verifying that `commands.new`, `commands.append`, `commands.getSessionId`, and `commands.getMessageContent` execute as expected and are safely captured.
- Tested failure scenarios to ensure extraction errors gracefully fallback into `stderr` and preserve the `chat.jsonl` atomic ordering without breaking the log syntax.
- `npm run check`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test` all pass. This concludes the Sessions Feature implementation!
