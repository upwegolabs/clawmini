# Development Log - Discord Adapter

## 2026-03-03 - Tuesday

### Initial Session Start
- Identified `09_discord_adapter` as the active feature folder.
- Starting Step 1: Scaffold Discord Adapter.

### Step 1: Scaffold Discord Adapter
- **Goal:** Create basic structure and build setup for the Discord adapter.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `src/adapter-discord` directory. (Done)
  - Create `src/adapter-discord/index.ts`. (Done)
  - Update `tsdown.config.ts` to include the new entry point. (Done)
  - Add `discord.js` to `package.json`. (Done)
- **Status:** Completed. Verified with `npm run build` and `node dist/adapter-discord/index.mjs`. All tests and checks passed.

### Step 2: Configuration & Security Implementation
- **Goal:** Define configuration schema and loading logic.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `src/adapter-discord/config.ts` with Zod schema. (Done)
  - Implement configuration loading from `.clawmini/adapters/discord/config.json`. (Done)
  - Add `isAuthorized(userId: string)` helper. (Done)
  - Add unit tests in `src/adapter-discord/config.test.ts`. (Done)
- **Status:** Completed. Verified with unit tests and full automated checks.

### Step 3: TRPC Client Connection
- **Goal:** Implement TRPC client to connect to the daemon.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `src/adapter-discord/client.ts`. (Done)
  - Implement a TRPC client that connects to the daemon via the Unix socket. (Done)
  - Create unit tests in `src/adapter-discord/client.test.ts`. (Done)
- **Status:** Completed. Verified with unit tests. All checks and tests passed.

### Step 4: Discord to Daemon Forwarding
- **Goal:** Forward authorized Discord DM messages to the Clawmini daemon.
- **Tasks:**
  - Initialize `discord.js` client in `src/adapter-discord/index.ts`. (Done)
  - Implement `messageCreate` listener for DMs. (Done)
  - Integrate with `readDiscordConfig` and `isAuthorized`. (Done)
  - Implement TRPC `sendMessage` forwarding. (Done)
  - Create comprehensive unit tests in `src/adapter-discord/index.test.ts`. (Done)
- **Status:** Completed. Verified with mocked `discord.js` tests. All checks and tests passed.

### Step 5: Daemon Message Observation Enhancement
- **Goal:** Update the daemon to support real-time message observation via TRPC.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `src/daemon/events.ts` with a global `EventEmitter` for the daemon.
  - Create `src/daemon/chats.ts` as a daemon-specific wrapper for `shared/chats.ts` that emits `message-appended` events.
  - Update `src/daemon/message.ts` and `src/daemon/router.ts` to use the new `chats.ts` wrapper.
  - Add `getMessages` and `waitForMessages` (long-polling) endpoints to the TRPC router in `src/daemon/router.ts`.
  - Update existing daemon tests (`message-extraction.test.ts`, `message-queue.test.ts`, `message-router.test.ts`) to mock the new `./chats.js` module.
  - Create comprehensive unit tests in `src/daemon/observation.test.ts`.
- **Status:** Completed. Verified with unit tests. All checks and tests passed.

### Step 6: Daemon to Discord Forwarding
- **Goal:** Forward messages from the Clawmini daemon back to the authorized Discord user.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `src/adapter-discord/forwarder.ts` with the observation loop logic.
  - Implement long-polling using `waitForMessages` TRPC endpoint.
  - Implement message chunking for Discord's 2000 character limit.
  - Update `src/adapter-discord/index.ts` to start the forwarder when the client is ready.
  - Create comprehensive unit tests in `src/adapter-discord/forwarder.test.ts`.
- **Status:** Completed. Verified with unit tests. All checks and tests passed.

### Step 7: State Management & Startup Sync
- **Goal:** Implement persistent state to track synced messages and ensure no messages are missed on startup.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `src/adapter-discord/state.ts` for `.clawmini/adapters/discord/state.json` management.
  - Implement `lastSyncedMessageId` tracking and persistence.
  - Update `src/adapter-discord/forwarder.ts` to load initial state and update it during the forwarding loop.
  - Create unit tests for state management.
- **Status:** Completed. Verified with unit tests and full automated checks.

### Step 8: Debouncing & Robustness
- **Goal:** Improve adapter reliability with message aggregation and error handling.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `Debouncer` utility in `src/adapter-discord/utils.ts`.
  - Use `Debouncer` in `src/adapter-discord/index.ts` to aggregate messages sent within 1 second.
  - Implement exponential backoff for daemon connection retries in `src/adapter-discord/forwarder.ts`.
  - Add/Update unit tests for debouncing and backoff logic.
- **Status:** Completed. Verified with unit tests and full automated checks.

### Step 9: Documentation
- **Goal:** Create setup documentation for the Discord adapter.
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `./docs/guides/discord_adapter_setup.md` with instructions for bot creation, token retrieval, and configuration. (Done)
- **Status:** Completed. Documentation created and verified.

## Final Review
- All steps for the Discord adapter are completed.
- Unit and integration tests cover all core components (client, config, forwarder, state, utils, index).
- TRPC observation enhancement implemented in daemon to support real-time message forwarding.
- State management ensures no messages are missed during restarts.
- Setup documentation provided.
