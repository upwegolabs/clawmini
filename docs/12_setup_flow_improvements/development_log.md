# Development Log

## Ticket 1: Agent Creation Side-effect (Chat Creation)
- Started investigating `src/cli/commands/agents.ts` and `src/shared/chats.ts`.
- Imported `listChats` and `createChat` from `src/shared/chats.ts`.
- Imported `readChatSettings` and `writeChatSettings` from `src/shared/workspace.ts`.
- Added check in `src/cli/commands/agents.ts` for existing chats using `listChats`.
- Added logic to output warning if chat already exists.
- Added logic to create chat and assign defaultAgent to agent id if chat didn't exist.
- Added tests in `src/cli/e2e/agents.test.ts` to assert correct chat creation and warn on existing chat scenarios.
- Ran formatting, linting, type checks, and tests successfully.

## Ticket 2: Init Command Flags and Agent Initialization
- Investigated `src/cli/commands/init.ts` and added `--agent` and `--agent-template` flags.
- Implemented logic to throw if `--agent-template` was passed without `--agent`.
- Refactored `initCmd` to reuse `writeAgentSettings`, `applyTemplateToAgent`, `createChat`, and `writeChatSettings` from `workspace.ts` and `chats.ts`.
- Modified `init.ts` to directly update `.clawmini/settings.json` via `fs` parsing for default chat instead of using missing export `writeSettings`.
- Added unit tests in `src/cli/e2e/init.test.ts`.
- Debugged test checking for incorrect `settings.json` file paths and updated `agent.json` and `chat.json` to `settings.json` in assertions.
- Ran all format, lint, check and test scripts locally. Verified all pass successfully.

## Ticket 3: Final Verification
- Ran all codebase checks: formatting (`npm run format:check`), linting (`npm run lint`), type checking (`npm run check`), and tests (`npm run test`).
- Verified that all unit and e2e tests pass for both `clawmini` daemon and web interface.
- Checked git status to ensure tree is clean before finalizing the feature.

## Ticket 7: Refactor Environment Enable Logic
- Extracted `enableEnvironment` function to `src/shared/workspace.ts`.
- Updated `src/cli/commands/environments.ts` to use `enableEnvironment`.
- Maintained exact logging format from original command logic inside `enableEnvironment`.
- Executed `npm run test` and `npm run check` with full passes.
- Verified manual execution of `node ./dist/cli/index.mjs environments enable cladding` in dummy directory.

## Ticket 8: Init Command `--environment` Flag
- Read `src/cli/commands/init.ts` and `src/cli/e2e/init.test.ts`.
- Updated `initCmd` to accept an `--environment <name>` flag.
- Imported and invoked `enableEnvironment(options.environment)` if the flag is provided after initialization.
- Added a new e2e test to `src/cli/e2e/init.test.ts` to assert that `--environment` correctly copies the environment template and updates `settings.json`.
- Fixed test environment conflict by clearing the `.clawmini` directory before the new test runs.
- Executed `npm run test` and `npm run check` with full passes.
